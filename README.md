# ci_optical_treatment
CDM code and archive to treat charge injection lines and diffuse optical background.

Full, pixel based treatment of CI lines of a defined frequency and a diffuse, uniform background.
The code is used to determine the evolution of the trap densities during multiple frames readouts in the image, store, serial areas.
These can be seen as effective densities of the traps during normal operations, allowing the treatement of CTI for X-ray events windows only, without worring about CI or diffuse flux at each frame readout.
